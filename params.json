Under the menu `Plugin>Segmentation`, you will find four new plugins:\r\n\r\n    - Jarek Sacha's K-Means Clustering the original K-Means plugin by Jarek Sacha\r\n    -  K-Means Clustering\r\n    - Fuzzy C-Means Clustering plugins\r\n    - Spatial Fuzzy C-Means Clustering\r\n\r\nPlugin Description\r\n==================\r\n\r\nThis is a set of ImageJ plugins for color image segmentation. The set features four plugins:\r\n\r\n\r\n* The original K-Means plugin from Jarek Sacha's IJ Plugin Toolkit (that you can also find [here](http://ij-plugins.sourceforge.net/plugins/clustering/))\r\n* A refactored version of the original K-Means plugin providing color space selection (RGB, XYZ, L*a*b*, HSB), a simpler initialization criterion and a few more visualization modes\r\n* A Fuzzy C-Means variant introducing another initialization criterion plus a new visualization mode\r\n* A Spatial version of the Fuzzy C-Means algorithm that considers, for each pixel, a window containing the neighbor pixels in order to compute the membership function\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n________\r\n\r\nColor space conversion\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\nColor images can be converted into four different color spaces (considering RGB) leading to differently clustered images:\r\n\r\n* XYZ a standardized color space, similar to RGB but with less correlated components\r\n* L*a*b* a perceptional uniform color space that provides human predictable segmentation results\r\n* HSB similar to L*a*b* for its purpose of giving a more human readable color representation, but differs in the representation of the luminance component and consequently of the chroma\r\n\r\nVisualization modes\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\n* Cluster Centroid Color each cluster has been assigned its centroid color (in case of color conversion the color space is converted back to RGB)\r\n* Gray Scale each pixel is labelled with the number of the cluster it belongs to, and the image range is stretched in 0-255\r\n* Random RGB a random RGB color is generated for each cluster, it may be very useful when many clusters share a similar centroid color value\r\n* Binary Stack a stack of binary images is outputted, each of those representing a cluster: a black pixel belongs to the current slice cluster, a white not. It may be useful to extract back the original region with an OR operation\r\n* Fuzzy Stack a stack of gray scaled images is used to show the membership values of each pixel to each cluster, the darker the pixel in a slice, the more the corresponding pixel in the original images belongs (in a fuzzy sense) to the currently selected cluster\r\n\r\n\r\nChangelog\r\n=========\r\n\r\n 26/12/2010\r\n \tRefactored the K-Means Plugin according to the new design (now the algorithm is much more independent form ImageJ API)\r\n\r\n 30/12/2010\r\n\tCreated a new package from the upcoming Fuzzy C-Means version of the plugin. Started to work on it.\r\n\r\n 3/01/2011\r\n\tStarted to work on the Spatial version of the Fuzzy C-Means algorithm.\r\n\r\n15/01/2011\r\n\tReleased version 1.0 of the plugin suite with several bugs fixed and a working spatial implementation\r\n\r\n5/02/2011\r\n\tReleased version 1.1 implementing a way to disable the random seeding",
